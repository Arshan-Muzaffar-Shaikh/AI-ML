AI & Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate core concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), with a particular focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). The projects cover end-to-end workflows, from text preprocessing to statistical analysis and feature engineering, and showcase the ability to apply algorithms to practical problems.

 Projects Overview
1. Text Preprocessing

Implemented tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation handling, stemming, lemmatization, and n-gram generation.

Key Skills: Data cleaning, normalization, feature preparation.

2. Text Analysis & Visualization

Computed statistics such as vocabulary size, unique lemmas, punctuation counts, and stopword frequency.

Performed POS tagging distribution and visualized results using bar plots.

Key Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization with Matplotlib.

3. Zipf‚Äôs Law & Heap‚Äôs Law

Validated Zipf‚Äôs Law by plotting rank vs frequency on log-log scale.

Explained Heap‚Äôs Law and its application in vocabulary growth modeling.

Key Skills: Statistical NLP, understanding of linguistic patterns.

4. Minimum Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)

Built a dynamic programming solution to compute the minimum operations (insertion, deletion, substitution) required to transform one string into another.

Case Study: Converting "reading" ‚Üí "writing" required 3 edits.

Key Skills: Algorithm design, dynamic programming, string similarity.

5. Bag of Words (BoW) Representation

Represented documents as frequency vectors.

Applied tokenization and stopword removal before building word-frequency matrices.

Key Skills: Feature engineering for ML, document-term representation.

6. TF and TF‚ÄìIDF Computation

Constructed TF matrix, IDF table, and TF‚ÄìIDF matrix for sample documents.

Highlighted the importance of words relative to corpus frequency.

Key Skills: Feature weighting, mathematical modeling, Pandas data manipulation.
